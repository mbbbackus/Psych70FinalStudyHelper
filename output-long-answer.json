   "Prompts for Long Answer (on the test you will pick 1 of 2):":{
      "1. Explain the basic principles of social identity theory: give three causes of group identification, and three consequences. What can create an overarching (or superordinate) identity? Give an example that illustrates a cause of identification, a consequence of identification, and an overarching identity.":[
         "Explains how people come to identify with groups and the consequences of group identification",
         "Principles: Contrast is necessary for category formation (there is no group until there is a salient out-group)",
         "Principles: People have a natural tendency to categorize when they see contrast",
         "Causes: perceived similarity, presence of dissimilar out-group, salience of group membership in situation",
         "Consequences: Out-group animosity, In-group favoritism",
         "Example: Political parties. Cause: Literally defined as separate groups with separate conventions and opinions. Consequence: Thouroughly divided government in that there is plenty of animosity between groups. Overarching identity\u2013businesses, small-town america, white christians vs workers, city folk, diverse identity-conscious people",
         "Example: Civil-rights movement. Causes: race/color of skin is pretty easy to notice, and it was explicitly given attention in official laws discriminating against black people. Consequences: Discrimination, lynching, segregation, formation of explicit in-groups such as KKK and black panthers (KKK obviously worse). The identity was attached to cultural backgrounds, socioeconomic status, and simply the color of one's skin."

      "3. List the five steps of helping.  For each step describe a barrier that might get in the way of engaging in helping and how one might overcome that barrier and therefore be more likely to engage in helping.  In your essay detail at least one social psychological experiment and explain what information that study reveals about helping behavior. ":[
         "Step 1: Notice that something has happened Barrier: time pressure, distractions",
         "Step 2: Interpret the event as an emergency Barrier: Pluralistic ignorance",
         "Step 3: Take responsibility for providing help Barriers: Bystander effect, diffusion of responsibility, normative influence to not involve, biases toward people in need",
         "Step 4: Decide how to help Barriers: feelings of incompetence, collapse of compassion",
         "Step 5: Provide help Barrier: cost-reward analysis",
         "NYC college students in study about stress problems, students didn't help as often when the groups they were in were bigger"

      "5. Many people overlook the importance of social factors in shaping our health.  Imagine you are at a dinner party trying to convince a skeptic that these forces matter: list three ways that social factors influence health.  For each way, describe one social psychological study or experiment that supports the claim. ":[
         "Social status influences health: Whitehall study showed that lower status workers in the british civil service had higher mortality rates than those at the top",
         "Social Support: Lachman, longitudinal study showed that social support predicts health maintenance",
         "Social Influence: normative influence and food choice. Given choice between healthy and unhealthy snack,  if trash full of healthy wrappers, the number of healthy foods eaten increased"
      ],
      "4. Imagine you just received an offer from your dream organization. The offer includes a discussion of your salary as well as location, vacation days, and health insurance. Given what you learned in the negotiation lecture and in the Harvard Business Review reading on negotiation how would you go about negotiating effectively? For full credit describe 4 principles discussed in the lecture and reading that you could take into account to negotiate effectively.   ":[

      "2. Explain how the Robber's Cave Experiment worked. Be sure to explain the 3 stages of the study and what happened during them. Give examples of overarching (i.e. superordinate) goals and how they affected the study participants. Give 2 conclusions about group interaction that can be drawn from this study. Explain how the results of the Robber's Cave Experiment are similar to the results of at least one other study cited in the Social Identity Theory lecture. ":[
         "Two different groups of boys were assembled at Robber's cave",
         "Stage 1: Totally isolate the two groups from one another for 5 days. Encourage bonding",
         "Stage 2: Create competitions for trophies and medals. Brought together for first time at dinner, called each other names and sang derogatory songs",
         "Stage 3: Integration. 6-7 days. Opportunities to reduce tension were presented, but had no effect, several events ended in food fights. Created superordinate (overarchingg) goals. Water Problem, a critical water faucet was blocked by researchers and blamed on vandals, the boys cooperated to fix it. Rattlers let eagles go first for water since they didn't have canteens. Getting a movie, researchers suggested they watch a movie that would cost $15, and the groups agreed to split the cost.",
         "Group relations improved after superordinate goals were acheived. They ate together, mixed seats, and decided to return home on one bus. Cheered when the staff okayed this.",
         "Conclusions: Accentuation effect explains perceptions of groups and group members. Minimal group experiments show groups can form from even small differences",
         "Actual Conclusions: Separation and competition can generate inter-group conflict",
         "Actual Conclusions: But cooperative pursuit of common goals and shared success can foster solidarity, cohesion, and liking",
         "They Saw a Game: In both studies the two groups are at odds even though they were somewhat randomly assigned to groups they're in."
